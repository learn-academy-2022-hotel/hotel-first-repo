# Natally's Branching Informational Commands

### Branching Vocab
- Branch - Pathway between local and remote
- Checkout - Navigating between branches in terminal
- Pull - Reconciling a diff from GitHub to our local
- Clone - adding a folder (repo) from GitHub to local
- Main branch - source of truth, don't push to main, but we do pull from main
- Merge - adding new code to main (source of truth)
- Pull request (PR) - allowing reviews of your code before merging into main
