# Molly's Branching Informational Commands

### Branching Vocab
- branch - pathway between local and remote
- checkout - navigating between branches in terminal
- pull - reconciling diff from Github to our local  
- clone - adding a folder 9repo) from Github to our local
- main branch - source of truth, don't push to main, but we do pull from main
- merge - adding new code to main (source of truth)
 - pull request (PR) - allowing code to be reviewed
