# Oscar's Branching Informational Commands

### Branching Vocab
- branch (pathway between local and remote)
- checkout (navigating between branches in terminal)
- pull (reconciling a diff from GitHub to our local)
- clone (adding a folder from Github to our local)
- main branch (source of truth)
- merge (adding new code to main)
- pull request (allowing reviews of your code before merging into main)
