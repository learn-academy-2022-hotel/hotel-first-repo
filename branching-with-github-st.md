### Branching Vocab
- branch: pathway between local and remote
- checkout: navigating between branches in terminal
- pull: reconciling a diff (changes) from GitHub to our local machine
- clone: adding a repo (repository) from GitHub to our local machine
- main branch: source of truth (protected), don't push to main, but we do pull (get updates) from main
- merge: adding new code (changes) to our main branch
- pull request (PR): requesting a request to update main branch (permission to merge branch to main)
